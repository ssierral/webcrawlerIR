# map_reduce.py
# Defines a single function, map_reduce, which takes an input
# dictionary i and applies the user-defined function mapper to each
# (input_key,input_value) pair, producing a list of intermediate 
# keys and intermediate values.  Repeated intermediate keys then 
# have their values grouped into a list, and the user-defined 
# function reducer is applied to the intermediate key and list of 
# intermediate values.  The results are returned as a list.
